# Little AI

## Introduction

Little A.I. is a free game (developed at the computer science department of the University of Lyon) which helps understand some of the challenges involved in developmental artificial intelligence.

The goal of the game is to achieve each level without knowing its "physical" representation.  
You only have access to few buttons which produce "bad" and "good" interactions, it is up to you to understand the world based on their result!

## Useful links

The game is available at: [pierreelliott.github.io/LittleAI-Web](https://pierreelliott.github.io/LittleAI-Web).

While the GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/pierreelliott/LittleAI-Web).

## Dependencies

This project uses the [Font Awesome](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_intro.asp) library for the icons.  
It isn't packed up in this project so you will need an internet connection or to download it yourself.

The GitHub repository of the iOS version can be found [here](https://github.com/OlivierGeorgeon/IOS-AImergence).

You can play a (really) old version of the game [right there](http://little-ai.com/).
